# Introduction  
### Usage: ./banhammer [options]  
  ./banhammer will read in words from stdin, identify any badspeak or old speak and output an  
  appropriate punishment message. The badspeak and oldspeak (with the newspeak translation)  
  that caused the punishment will be printed after the message. If statistics are enabled  
  punishment messages are suppressed and only statistics will be printed.  
    `-t <ht_size>`: Hash table size set to <ht_size>. (default: 10000)  
    `-f <bf_size>`: Bloom filter size set to <bf_size>. (default 2^19)  
    `-s`          : Enables the printing of statistics.  
    `-m`          : Enables move-to-front rule.  
    `-h`          : Display program synopsis and usage.   
  
## Maximum values
  There are no maximum values for either of the two options that accept arguments, values exceeding one hundred billion will result in a segfault. 
## node\_create usage:  
   NULL passed into the oldspeak argument will create a sentinal node where the oldspeak and newspeak field will point to NULL.
